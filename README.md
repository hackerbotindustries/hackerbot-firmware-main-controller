# Main Controller Interface

This document outlines the serial commands used to interface with the **Main Controller** of the Hackerbot system. The controller manages communication with the robotâ€™s core subsystems: **Base**, **Head**, and **Arm**. Each component accepts specific commands over a serial connection, allowing control over movement, navigation, and actuation.

## ðŸ“¡ Communication Overview

Commands are sent as ASCII strings over a serial interface. Each command follows a structure:

```
<COMMAND> <PARAMETERS>
```

For example:
```
B_GOTO,2.1,-0.5,90.0,0.1
```
